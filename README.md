# Open Whot

A varitation of the Naija Whot Game, written with React Native.

*(blah blah blah ...)*


## Launching with Expo

 `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.


## Launch on an Emulator

if you intend to run with an emulator, you need to eject this project from Create React Natives Build Script.

**Warning:** Running eject is a permanent action (aside from whatever version control system you use). An ejected app will require you to have an [Xcode and/or Android Studio environment](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) set up.

```bash
npm run eject
```

then

`npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
