or

#### - Launch on an Emulator

Clone repo first

```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/kodejuice/openwhot.git
$ cd openwhot
$ npm install
```

if you intend to run with an emulator, you need to eject this project from Create React Natives Build Script.

```bash
npm run eject
```

then
`npm run android` or `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
